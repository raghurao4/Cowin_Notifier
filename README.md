- ðŸŒ± raghurao4/Cowin_Notifier is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository, the desktop application allows to create multiple query for your needs regarding vaccination slot search. 
- You can choose for mail or desktop notification, by default it is set to desktop notification.
- Change the sleep time between your query to the server < default setting is 60sec >, currently allowed filter is upto age limit and dose level. If demand arise, I will update the vaccince type as well to include in the search query.
